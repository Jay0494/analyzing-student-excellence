### **Recommendations:**

1. **Focus on Math Proficiency**:
   - With 45.6% of students in the "Basic" category and only 5.8% in "Advanced", there is a need to boost math proficiency. Additional targeted math interventions, such as tutoring or adaptive learning platforms, should be considered for students in the "Basic" and "Below Basic" categories.

2. **Improve Reading Performance**:
   - While 43.4% of students are proficient, only 7.9% are in the advanced category. Expanding programs that promote reading comprehension and critical thinking, like book clubs or enhanced reading assignments, could raise the number of advanced readers.

3. **Enhance Writing Skills**:
   - Writing performance shows a similar trend to reading, with only 7.8% of students in the advanced category. To encourage growth in writing skills, incorporate more writing-intensive assignments and feedback sessions. Consider introducing creative writing or essay contests to inspire students.

4. **Gender-Based Interventions**:
   - With a relatively balanced gender distribution (51.8% female, 48.2% male) but slightly higher average scores for females, consider exploring gender-specific teaching techniques. Analyze whether teaching strategies are equally effective for both genders, and ensure that any disparity in performance is addressed.

5. **Addressing the Needs of "Below Basic" Students**:
   - A significant portion of students (especially in math) are categorized as "Below Basic". These students need targeted support through remedial programs, individualized attention, or specialized resources that cater to foundational skills.

### **Next Steps:**

1. **Conduct a Gap Analysis**:
   - Perform a deeper dive into why some students remain in the "Below Basic" or "Basic" categories. Investigate factors such as socio-economic background, learning disabilities, or access to resources that may be influencing their performance.

2. **Implement a Data-Driven Tutoring Program**:
   - Launch a tutoring or mentoring program that uses the performance data to prioritize students who are in the "Below Basic" and "Basic" categories. Focus on personalized learning plans to address specific skill gaps in math, reading, and writing.

3. **Professional Development for Teachers**:
   - Provide professional development focused on differentiated instruction to help teachers better meet the diverse learning needs of students, especially those who struggle. Include training on how to encourage higher-level thinking for students in the proficient range to push them toward advanced categories.

4. **Continuous Monitoring and Feedback**:
   - Develop dashboards or ongoing assessments to regularly track student progress, ensuring that interventions are effective. Set quarterly goals for moving students from "Basic" to "Proficient" or "Advanced".

5. **Engage Parents and Guardians**:
   - Involve parents in the process by sharing individual performance reports and offering resources they can use at home to support their children's learning. Regular parent-teacher meetings could discuss student progress and areas for improvement.

By addressing these areas, the overall student performance in numeracy and literacy can be improved, with a particular focus on bringing more students into the proficient and advanced levels.
